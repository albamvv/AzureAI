# Evaluate Generative AI Model Performance

This exercise guides you through manually and automatically evaluating the performance of generative AI models in Azure AI Foundry using gpt-4o and gpt-4o-mini.


## 1. Create an Azure AI Foundry Hub and Project

In Azure AI Foundry, every project must belong to an AI Hub. An AI Hub acts as a central control plane that manages:
- model deployments  
- datasets  
- evaluation jobs  
- resource connections  
- monitoring and observability  

The steps below initialize that environment.

---

1. Go to https://ai.azure.com and sign in with the provided credentials. Close any initial help or quick start panes.
2. Navigate to Management Center → All resources and select “Create new → AI hub”.
    - https://ai.azure.com/managementCenter/allResources

    <p align="center"><img src="./images/management_center.png" height="280px"></p>

    Note: 
    - in this screen, you are creating a new Azure AI Foundry project, which serves as the workspace where models, datasets, evaluations, and AI workflows will live.
    - Azure automatically creates (or lets you rename) an AI Hub, which acts as the central control plane for:
    - - organizing AI resources
    - - securely storing connections
    - - providing shared infrastructure for models and evaluations
    - - enabling collaboration within the workspace
    - - This is required because every Azure AI Foundry project must be attached to a hub.

    
3. In the creation wizard:

    <p align="center"><img src="./images/crear_projecto_hub.png" height="280px"></p>

   - Enter a valid project name.
   - Select “Create a new hub” and rename it.
   - Configure:
     - Subscription: CS-SUB-0445
     - Resource group: AI-102
     - Region: any recommended region

4. Create the project and wait until deployment is complete.

### Why these settings matter
- The **hub** aggregates all AI operations: model inference, quotas, endpoints, monitoring, and shared assets.
- The **region** determines availability and latency for Azure AI services.
- The **resource group** organizes all Azure assets, simplifying cleanup.
- The **subscription** defines quota limits for model deployments, evaluations, and token usage.

## 2. Deploy the Models

### Deploy gpt-4o
1. In the project, go to My assets → Models + endpoints.
2. Select “+ Deploy model → Deploy base model”.
3. Search for and select gpt-4o.
4. Configure:
   - Deployment name: valid unique name
   - Deployment type: Standard
   - Automatic version update: Enabled
   - Model version: latest available
   - Connected AI resource: your Azure OpenAI connection
   - Tokens per Minute: 50K (or the maximum available)
   - Content filter: DefaultV2
5. Deploy the model.

### Deploy gpt-4o-mini
Repeat the same steps to deploy gpt-4o-mini.

## 3. Manual Model Evaluation

1. Download the evaluation dataset:
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-studio/refs/heads/main/data/travel_evaluation_data.jsonl
2. In Azure AI Foundry, go to Protect and govern → Evaluation.
3. In the Manual evaluations tab, select “+ New manual evaluation”.
4. Select your gpt-4o deployment.
5. Set the system message:
   Assist users with travel-related inquiries, offering tips, advice, and recommendations as a knowledgeable travel agent.
6. Import the .jsonl file and map the fields:
   - Input → Question
   - Expected response → ExpectedResponse
7. Run the evaluation to generate the Output column.
8. Review each response and score it with 👍 / 👎.
9. Save the results.

## 4. Automated Model Evaluation

1. In the Evaluation page, open the Automated evaluations tab.
2. Select “Create a new evaluation → Evaluate a model”.
3. Choose the previously uploaded dataset.
4. Select gpt-4o-mini as the model.
5. Use the same system message:
   Assist users with travel-related inquiries, offering tips, advice, and recommendations as a knowledgeable travel agent.
6. Set Query: {{item.question}}

### Add Evaluators

#### Model scorer (Semantic similarity)
- Criteria: Semantic_similarity
- Grade with: gpt-4o
- Output: {{sample.output_text}}
- Ground truth: {{item.ExpectedResponse}}

#### Likert-scale evaluator (Relevance)
- Criteria: Relevance
- Grade with: gpt-4o
- Query: {{item.question}}

#### Text similarity (F1 Score)
- Criteria: F1_Score
- Ground truth: {{item.ExpectedResponse}}

#### Hateful and unfair content
- Criteria: Hate_and_unfairness
- Query: {{item.question}}

7. Review configuration, assign a name, and submit the evaluation.
8. Wait for completion and review the metrics.
9. Open the Data tab to view per-item scores and reasoning generated by the evaluator model.

## 5. Clean Up Resources

1. Go to https://portal.azure.com.
2. Navigate to Resource groups.
3. Select the resource group used during the exercise.
4. Click “Delete resource group”.
5. Confirm by entering the resource group name.

## Outcome

By completing this exercise, you will have deployed generative AI models, run manual and automated evaluations, analyzed metrics such as semantic similarity, relevance, and F1 score, reviewed harmful-content detection, and cleaned up all Azure resources to avoid additional costs.
